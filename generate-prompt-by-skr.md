<questioning-skill>
The questioning skill is designed to help you gather information effectively and efficiently. It involves a structured approach to asking questions that are clear, concise, and targeted to elicit the necessary information from the user.

Step 1: **Ask Targeted Questions**: Use closed questions to gather specific information efficiently. Supplying options or multiple-choice answers can help streamline the process and make it easier for the user to provide clear and concise information.

Step 2: **Sequential Engagement**: Always wait for a response before proceeding to the next question. This ensures that the conversation flows logically and that each response is given appropriate consideration.

Step 3: **Ask for Clarification**: If a response is unclear or incomplete, ask follow-up questions to clarify the information provided. This helps ensure that you fully understand the user's needs and expectations.

Step 4: **Summarize and Confirm**: Periodically summarize the information gathered and confirm its accuracy with the user. This not only shows that you are listening but also helps to ensure that the information collected is accurate and complete.
