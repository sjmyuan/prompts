> Problem: "A line of code in Java Project was accidentally deleted during the resolution of merge conflicts"

To better understand the problem, I have a few questions:

1. Who was resolving the merge conflicts?
2. When did the accidental deletion occur?
3. Which line of code was deleted?
4. How critical is the deleted line to the project's functionality?

> 1. A team member
> 2. After we merge a feature branch into master branch
> 3. A line of code to get the required information from external service
> 4. The application can't start

Based on your answers, the problem definition is as follows:

**Problem Definition**: A line of code in a Java project, responsible for getting required information from an external service, was accidentally deleted during the resolution of merge conflicts by a team member. As a result, the application cannot start.

Please confirm if this problem definition accurately reflects the situation.

Great, now let's proceed with collecting data. I have some questions to collect more information about the situation:

1. What is the specific line of code that was deleted?
2. Can you provide the name of the file and the method where the line of code was located?
3. Were there any backup versions or version control systems in place that could help recover the deleted line of code?
4. How many team members were involved in the merge conflict resolution?

> 1. It's sensitive, can't provide it
> 2. No, it's sensitive
> 3. Yes, we use Git
> 4. only one

I understand that some information is sensitive and cannot be provided. Based on the information you've shared, here's the problem definition and data:

**Problem Definition**: A sensitive line of code in a Java project, responsible for getting required information from an external service, was accidentally deleted during the resolution of merge conflicts by a team member. As a result, the application cannot start.

**Data**:

- Sensitive line of code was deleted.
- The line of code was located in a sensitive file and method.
- Git is being used as a version control system.
- Only one team member was involved in the merge conflict resolution.

Please confirm if the problem definition and data are accurate.

> Confirm

Now that the problem definition and data are confirmed, I will proceed with asking "why" questions to identify the root causes of the problem:

1. Why was the sensitive line of code accidentally deleted during the merge conflict resolution?
2. Why wasn't the deletion detected before the merge was completed?
3. Was there a code review process in place for the merge? If so, why didn't the code review catch the deletion?

> 1. the team member don't know the line of code
> 2. No one aware of the deletion
> 3. Yes, TL will review the pull request, but he didn't notice the deletion

Based on your answers, I have more questions:

1. Why didn't the team member who resolved the merge conflict know about the importance of the deleted line of code?
2. Why didn't the Team Lead notice the deletion during the code review process?
3. Are there any automated tests in place to catch issues like this before merging code changes? If not, why?

> 1. we didn't share the code details in code diff meeting, just share the work summary
> 2. there are too many changes, which need big effort to review it, TL can't go through the code line by line
> 3. No, it's a legacy code, there is no test

Based on your answers, I have identified the following root causes and suggested actions:

**Root Causes**:

1. Insufficient communication about the importance of specific code lines during code diff meetings.
2. The large number of changes during the merge made it difficult for the Team Lead to thoroughly review the code, leading to the oversight of the deleted line.
3. The lack of automated tests for the legacy code contributed to the issue going undetected.

**Suggested Actions**:

1. Improve communication during code diff meetings by discussing critical code lines and their importance.
2. Break down large merges into smaller, more manageable chunks to facilitate a more thorough code review process.
3. Gradually introduce automated tests for the legacy code to catch issues like this before merging code changes.

Please confirm if these root causes and suggested actions are accurate and acceptable.

**Summary**

**Problem Definition**: A sensitive line of code in a Java project, responsible for getting required information from an external service, was accidentally deleted during the resolution of merge conflicts by a team member. As a result, the application cannot start.

**Questions and Answers**:

1. Q: Why was the sensitive line of code accidentally deleted during the merge conflict resolution?  
    A: The team member didn't know the line of code.
    
2. Q: Why wasn't the deletion detected before the merge was completed?  
    A: No one was aware of the deletion.
    
3. Q: Was there a code review process in place for the merge? If so, why didn't the code review catch the deletion?  
    A: Yes, the Team Lead reviewed the pull request, but he didn't notice the deletion.
    
4. Q: Why didn't the team member who resolved the merge conflict know about the importance of the deleted line of code?  
    A: The team didn't share the code details in the code diff meeting, just the work summary.
    
5. Q: Why didn't the Team Lead notice the deletion during the code review process?  
    A: There were too many changes, which required a significant effort to review, and the Team Lead couldn't go through the code line by line.
    
6. Q: Are there any automated tests in place to catch issues like this before merging code changes? If not, why?  
    A: No, it's a legacy code, and there is no test.
