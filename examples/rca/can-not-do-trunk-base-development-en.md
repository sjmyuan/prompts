> Problem: "We can't change our branching policy from GitHub Flow to Trunk-Based Development".

To better understand the problem, I have a few questions:

1. What is the current branching policy you are using?
2. What are the reasons for wanting to change the branching policy from GitHub Flow to Trunk-Based Development?
3. Have you encountered any specific issues or obstacles that prevent you from making the change?

> 1. GitHub Flow
> 2. Improve the frequency of integration and deployment, decrease the effort of resolving conflicts, make the deployment process easier and avoid to block deployment.
> 3. Our QA don't agree with merging untested code to master branch and deploying uncompleted feature to production. And we can't automated our devices test.

Based on your answers, the problem definition is as follows:

**Problem Definition**: You want to change your branching policy from GitHub Flow to Trunk-Based Development to improve integration and deployment frequency, decrease conflict resolution effort, simplify the deployment process, and avoid blocking deployments. However, the change is not possible because the QA team disagrees with merging untested code to the master branch and deploying uncompleted features to production, and device tests cannot be automated.

Please confirm if this problem definition accurately reflects the situation.

Great, now let's proceed with collecting data. I have some questions to collect more information about the situation:

1. What is the size of your development team?
2. What is the size of your QA team?
3. What tools and technologies are being used for development, testing, and deployment?
4. Are there any specific reasons why device tests cannot be automated?

> 1. 5 Dev
> 2. 2 QA
> 3. Java, Cypress, GitHub Actions
> 4. There is no off-the-shelf techniques to automated device test, and we don't have time to develop the techniques by ourself.

Based on your answers, I have more questions:

1. How often do you currently deploy to production?
2. How long does it typically take for a feature to go from development to production under the current branching policy?
3. What kind of devices are involved in the device tests that you can't automate?

Please provide your answers to these questions.

> 1. 1-2 months
> 2. more than 1 month
> 3. sensitive data, a kind of hardware

Based on the information you provided, here's the problem definition and data:

**Problem Definition**: You want to change your branching policy from GitHub Flow to Trunk-Based Development to improve integration and deployment frequency, decrease conflict resolution effort, simplify the deployment process, and avoid blocking deployments. However, the change is not possible because the QA team disagrees with merging untested code to the master branch and deploying uncompleted features to production, and device tests cannot be automated.

**Data**:
- Development team size: 5 developers
- QA team size: 2 QA engineers
- Tools and technologies: Java, Cypress, GitHub Actions
- Device tests automation is not possible due to the lack of off-the-shelf techniques, and the team doesn't have the time to develop custom techniques.
- Deployment frequency: 1-2 months
- Time from development to production: more than 1 month
- Devices involved in tests: sensitive data hardware

Please confirm if the problem definition and data are accurate.

Now that the problem definition and data are confirmed, I will proceed with asking "why" questions to identify the root causes of the problem:

1. Why does the QA team disagree with merging untested code to the master branch and deploying uncompleted features to production?
2. Why is there no time to develop custom techniques for automating device tests?
3. Why haven't alternative branching strategies, such as feature toggles or environment-specific branches, been considered to address the QA team's concerns?

> 1. they want to keep master branch to be deployable and don't want the uncompleted feature to affect the feature on production.
> 2. it need huge effort, and we don't know how to do it right now.
> 3. We want to use feature toggles, but we don't have enough confidence to say it can ensure the stability of production

Based on your answers, I have identified the following root causes and suggested actions:

Root Causes:
1. The QA team's concerns about merging untested code and deploying uncompleted features to production are preventing the change to Trunk-Based Development.
2. Lack of time and knowledge to develop custom techniques for automating device tests.
3. Lack of confidence in using feature toggles to ensure the stability of production.

Suggested Actions:
1. Educate the team about the benefits of Trunk-Based Development and address their concerns by implementing best practices, such as using feature flags and maintaining a stable master branch through continuous integration and testing.
2. Allocate time and resources to research and develop custom techniques for automating device tests or explore third-party solutions that could help automate these tests.
3. Investigate and learn from successful implementations of feature toggles in similar projects or industries to build confidence in using them to ensure production stability.

Please confirm if these root causes and suggested actions are accurate and acceptable.

**Questions and Answers**:

1. Q: Why does the QA team disagree with merging untested code to the master branch and deploying uncompleted features to production?
   A: They want to keep the master branch deployable and don't want the uncompleted feature to affect the features on production.

2. Q: Why is there no time to develop custom techniques for automating device tests?
   A: It needs a huge effort, and the team doesn't know how to do it right now.

3. Q: Why haven't alternative branching strategies, such as feature toggles or environment-specific branches, been considered to address the QA team's concerns?
   A: The team wants to use feature toggles but doesn't have enough confidence to say it can ensure the stability of production.
