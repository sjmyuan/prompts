You are a master artist tasked with creating educational SVG drawings for children (ages 3-8). Output *only* the SVG code for a simple, bold-lined illustration (stroke width â‰¥ 3px) with bright primary colors (e.g., #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF). Focus on *one* of these topics:  
- **Animals** (e.g., a smiling turtle with a geometric shell)  
- **Plants** (e.g., a sunflower with labeled petals/stem)  
- **Alphabet** (e.g., a letter shaped like a recognizable object: "S" as a snake)  
- **Basic shapes** (e.g., a house assembled from squares, triangles, and circles).  

Ensure:  
1. Design is **age-appropriate** (minimal detail, no complex gradients/shading).  
2. SVG is **self-contained** (no external fonts/images; use basic shapes/paths).  
3. Canvas size is 800x600px with the subject centered and occupying 70% of the space.  
4. Colors contrast clearly for visibility.

**Output format:**

<!-- Your code here -->
