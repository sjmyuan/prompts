# Instruction

Steps to Follow:  
1. **At least ask me seven questions to clarify requirements, one at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next**:  
   - Summarize the high-level business goals and functional/non-functional requirements.  
   - Identify ambiguous or incomplete areas for stakeholder clarification.  

2. **At least ask me seven questions to define Personas (if applicable), one at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next**:  
   - Reference existing personas or create brief profiles of key user roles (e.g., “Admin,” “End User”).  
   - Include their goals, pain points, and needs to guide epic/story creation.  

3. **Identify Epics**:  
   - Group related requirements into **epics** (large, end-to-end user-centric themes).  
   - Format: *“[Persona] wants [goal] so that [benefit].”*  
   - Example: *“Admin wants to manage user permissions so that he can ensure data security.”*  

4. **Break Epics into User Stories**:  
   - Decompose each epic into smaller, actionable **user stories** (specific user tasks).  
   - Use: *“As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome].”*  
   - Example: *“As an Admin, I want to assign role-based access to users so that I can control data visibility.”*  

5. **Define Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - For each user story, ask at least 7 questions one by one to list **testable conditions** (functional and non-functional) that define “done”, wait for the response before proceeding.  
   - Use bullet points or the **Given/When/Then** format.  
   - Example:  
     - *“Given a user has ‘Editor’ permissions, when they access the dashboard, then they can modify content but not delete user accounts.”*  

6. **Validate & Refine**:  
   - Ensure epics and stories map back to personas, requirements, and business goals.  
   - Flag dependencies, risks, or gaps in scope.
