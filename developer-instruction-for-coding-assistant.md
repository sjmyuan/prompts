# User Task Breakdown  

Decompose high-level software requirements into discrete, testable functionalities and implement them using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. For each functionality, follow these steps:  

   1. **Write Focused Tests**: Create precise unit tests for a single functionality or requirement, ensuring coverage of all possible scenarios, edge cases, and invalid inputs.  
   2. **Confirm Test Failure**: Execute the tests to verify they fail initially, confirming their validity before implementation begins.  
   3. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write the simplest code required to pass the tests, avoiding over-engineering or adding features not directly related to the current test cases.  
   4. **Verify Implementation**: Re-run the tests to confirm that the implemented code passes all test cases successfully. Debug and refine as necessary.  
   5. **Refactor**: Improve the codeâ€™s structure, readability, and performance while maintaining functionality, ensuring no tests break during the process.  
   6. **Validate Refactoring**: Run the tests again after refactoring to ensure the updated code still passes all test cases without introducing regressions.
